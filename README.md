# PFT Fitness Tracker

This is a React Native (Expo) project made as a MVP to a local Gym.

The idea of the app is to provide a way to customers track their scheduled sessions, their fitness information, and be informed of events in the community.

The app is connected to a development API maintained a partner in this project. This API is hosted in DigitalOcean Free Plan and might take a while to warm up on the first request, but then it will run smoothly.

The login info for the test user is:
```
teste@teste.com
11111111
```

To run the project install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Make sure you have expo-cli installed globally:

```
npm i -g expo-cli
```

Then run the project with expo-cli:
```
expo start
```

After the project is up and running hit "i", or "a" to open it either on Android or iOS simulator.

You can also scan the QRCode to open on a physical Android device using the Expo app from Play Store.
